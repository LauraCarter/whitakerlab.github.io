## What is the SSI?

## What is Collaborations Workshop?

## The Lab's Reflections

At the lab meeting after the event, each member that attended was asked to produce a slide reflecting on their experience at CollabW21.
They were asked to highlight something they really enjoyed, was unexpected, or completely different to past conference experiences (signified by the :rocket: emoji); and a topic that resonated with them, got them thinking, that theyâ€™d like to share/discuss with the lab (signified by the :thinking: emoji).
You can see their slides below.

As you can see, themes around disability, diversity, inclusion and accessibility resonated particularly strongly within the group.

Additionally on the third day of CollabW, Sarah and Patricia's hackday projects on [Research Dugnads](https://research-dugnads.github.io/dugnads-hq/) and [Coding Confessions](https://coding-confessions.github.io/) won 3rd and 2nd place, respectively!
Well done Sarah and Patricia!
